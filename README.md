# toEatly with Mongoose

## You are on the master branch. Please checkout `live_code` and work there.

Clone this repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/benhulan/toEatly_mongoose.git
```

Change directories into your new project folder:

```bash
cd toEatly_mongoose
```

If you type ` git checkout live_code` it won't work because you don't have all the branches. You need to fetch them:

```
git fetch --all
```

If you type `git branch` you won't see everything you have, but try this:
```
git checkout live_code
```

Now you are on the `live_code` branch. You also have the solution branch, which you can access with `git checkout solution`
